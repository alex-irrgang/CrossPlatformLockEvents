#  [DBusSharp](http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp)
ndesk-dbus is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as dbus-sharp, or "managed D-Bus" to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap libdbus).

D-Bus is an inter-process communication framework that lets applications interface with the system event bus as well as allowing them to talk to one another in a peer-to-peer configuration.
